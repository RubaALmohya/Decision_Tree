# Decision_Tree
##Machine Learning:
Is a subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on their own.

## Work of Machine Learning:
A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it.

 


## Types of Machine Learning

### ML can be classified into three types:
1.	Supervised learning 
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it to predicts the output. 

Supervised Types:
-	Classification
-	Regression


 




2.	Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.

Unsupervised types:
-	Clustering
-	Association

 




## Decision Tree:
Is a supervised ML technique for make predictions, the forefront of practical tools for classification and regression, also she solves the problem of ML by transforming the data into tree representation. 

### Advantages of Decision Tree:
-	Simple to understand and interpret.
-	Requires little data preparation.
-	Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.

### Disadvantages of Decision Tree:
-	it canâ€™t be used in big data.
-	Decision tree often involves higher time to train the model.



## Decision Tree built:
Behaves like a tree structure, DT is built by repeatedly splitting, training data into smaller and smaller samples.
Three kinds of nodes in DT:
-	Root node 
o	Select the decision rule which has the largest information.
-	Decision node
o	Contains a condition to split the data.
-	Leaf node
o	Helps us to decide the class of new data point.


 


## Decision Tree work:
DT it works on the principle of conditions, we check conditions at a node, and split the data as per the result of the conditional statement.
